# HLS Streaming with SwiftUI
Basic implementation of VideoPlayer for SwiftUI to play remote media files using HTTP Live Streaming (HLS). Multiple views provide different implementations, ranging a simple player implementation to a more advanced setup with a view model that continiously monitors the playback buffer using AVPlayer's AVPlayerItem through use of Combine and Observers. More information about HLS streaming can be found on Apple's website https://developer.apple.com/streaming/.
